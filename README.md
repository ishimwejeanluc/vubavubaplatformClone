## 1. Overview

This document describes the architecture for a food delivery platform (Vuba Vuba clone) using Node.js, Express, and microservices. The system enables users to order food, merchants to manage menus, riders to deliver, and admins to oversee operationsâ€”all with secure authentication, payment integration, and notifications.

---

## 2. High-Level Architecture

* **API Gateway:** Central entry point, JWT validation, request routing.
* **Auth Service:** User authentication, authorization, role management.
* **Merchant Service:** Merchant/restaurant management, menu CRUD.
* **Order Service:** Order processing, status tracking, order items, order history.
* **Payment Service:** Integration with KPAY for payments.
* **Rider Service:** Rider management and delivery assignment.
* **Notification Service:** Event-driven notifications (email/SMS/push).
* **Message Broker:** (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for inter-service events.
* **Database:** Each service owns its data/tables (PostgreSQL recommended).

---

## 3. Microservices & Responsibilities

### API Gateway

* Validates JWT tokens and user roles.
* Routes requests to appropriate services.
* Handles global error responses.

### Auth Service

* Registers users (customers, merchants, riders, admins).
* Handles login and JWT issuance.
* Manages user roles and password policies.
* **Admin Features:** View all users, activate/deactivate accounts, change roles, edit user profiles.

### Merchant Service

* Allows merchants to manage their restaurant profiles.
* Supports CRUD for menu items (food, prices, availability).
* Exposes menu browsing endpoints to customers.
* **Admin Features:** View all merchants, activate/deactivate merchants, edit/delete merchants, view all menus.

### Order Service

* Receives order requests from customers.
* Links orders to customers and merchants.
* Tracks order status: pending, ready, assigned, accepted, delivered, canceled.
* Manages order items (food, quantity, total).
* Tracks order history for user visibility.
* **Admin Features:** View all orders, filter/search, update/cancel orders, view order history.

### Payment Service

* Receives payment requests post-order.
* Integrates with payment integration like stripe or flutterwave for transaction processing.
* Updates payment status in order records.
* **Admin Features:** View all payments, refund payments, force status change, view payment history.

### Rider Service

* Manages rider profiles and availability.
* Handles delivery assignments and status (assigned, accepted, delivered).
* **Admin Features:** View all riders, activate/deactivate riders, assign orders to riders, manage delivery assignments.

### Notification Service

* Listens for events (order placed, order ready, delivered, payment success).
* Sends notifications via email, SMS, or push to customers, merchants, riders.
* **Admin Features:** View notification logs, resend notifications, configure templates.

### Notification Service

* **Stateless (no database tables required).**
* Listens to events and sends notifications via external providers (email, SMS, push).
* May optionally log notification events for admin/audit purposes.

---

## 5. Service Communication

* **Synchronous:** HTTP REST via API Gateway (request-response).
* **Asynchronous:** Events via Message Broker (RabbitMQ).

  * E.g., Order placed, payment successful, order ready, delivery assigned.
  * Notification Service subscribes to relevant events.

---

## 6. Order & Notification Flow

1. **User Registration/Login:** Auth Service issues JWT.
2. **Merchant Menu Management:** Merchant Service allows menu CRUD.
3. **Placing an Order:** Customer sends order request via API Gateway to Order Service.
4. **Payment Processing:** Order Service requests Payment Service .
5. **Order Status Update:** Merchant marks order as ready.
6. **Assignment to Rider:** Admin assigns ready order to available rider (via Rider Service).
7. **Delivery Process:** Rider accepts assignment, marks order as delivered.
8. **Order History:** User sees updated order status/history at each step.
9. **Notifications:**
   * Order placed: Notify customer, merchant.
   * Payment success: Notify customer.
   * Order ready: Notify admin, rider.
   * Delivery assigned: Notify rider.
   * Delivered: Notify customer, merchant.

## 7. Events & Listeners (per Service)

Below are the main events each service publishes and listens to, along with their typical payloads:

### **Order Service**

* **Publishes:**
  * `order.placed` â€“ `{ orderId, customerId, merchantId, orderItems, totalPrice }`
  * `order.ready` â€“ `{ orderId, merchantId }`
  * `order.canceled` â€“ `{ orderId, customerId, merchantId }`
  * `order.delivered` â€“ `{ orderId, riderId, customerId }`
* **Listens to:**
  * `payment.success` (from Payment Service)
  * `payment.failed` (from Payment Service)
  * `assignment.created` (from Rider Service)
  * `delivery.accepted` (from Rider Service)
  * `delivery.delivered` (from Rider Service)

---

### **Merchant Service**

* **Publishes:**
  * `menu.updated` â€“ `{ merchantId, menuItems }`
  * `order.ready` (when a merchant marks an order as ready)
* **Listens to:**
  * `order.placed` (to receive new orders for merchant)
  * `order.canceled` (to update merchant dashboard)

---

### **Payment Service**

* **Publishes:**
  * `payment.success` â€“ `{ paymentId, orderId, amount, customerId }`
  * `payment.failed` â€“ `{ paymentId, orderId, error }`
* **Listens to:**
  * `order.placed` (to initiate payment process)

---

### **Rider Service**

* **Publishes:**
  * `delivery.accepted` â€“ `{ assignmentId, riderId, orderId }`
  * `delivery.delivered` â€“ `{ assignmentId, riderId, orderId }`
* **Listens to:**
  * `assignment.created` (to receive new delivery assignments)
  * `order.ready` (to prepare for delivery)

---

### **Notification Service**

* **Listens to (main events):**
  * `order.placed` (notify customer, merchant)
  * `payment.success` (notify customer)
  * `payment.failed` (notify customer)
  * `order.ready` (notify admin, rider)
  * `assignment.created` (notify rider)
  * `delivery.accepted` (notify customer, merchant)
  * `delivery.delivered` (notify customer, merchant, admin)
  * `order.canceled` (notify customer, merchant)
* **Publishes:**
  * Notifies via email/SMS/push (no events, direct external calls).

## 8. Project Structure

```
vubavuba-platform/
â”œâ”€â”€ api-gateway/              # Routing & JWT
â”œâ”€â”€ auth-service/             # User management
â”œâ”€â”€ merchant-service/         # Restaurants & menus
â”œâ”€â”€ order-service/            # Orders & items
â”œâ”€â”€ payment-service/          # Payment integration
â”œâ”€â”€ rider-service/            # Riders & assignments
â”œâ”€â”€ notification-service/     # Event-driven notifications
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml        # Service orchestration
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
```

Each service contains its own:

* `src/controllers/` (request handlers)
* `src/models/` (database schemas)
* `src/routes/` (Express routes)
* `src/services/` (business logic)
* `src/app.js` (entry point)

---

## 9. Extensibility & Best Practices

* **Loose Coupling:** Each service operates independently, communicates via events.
* **Single Responsibility:** Each service has a focused domain (auth, orders, payments, etc).
* **Security:** JWT, role-based access, secure payment integration.
* **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling possible for each microservice.
* **Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI docs per service.
